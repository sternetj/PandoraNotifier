##Description
The Pandora Mini-Player opens a window when you listen to music on Pandora.com

The mini-player allows you to like, dislike, pause/play, or skip a song.

The mini-player has a slick interface that shows the title of the song, the song artist,  the album the song is on, and a large image of the album artwork.

The mini-player is a handy too that allows you to listen and interact with music on Pandora without using the full webpage. It is great if you want a small indicator on your screen of if you don't want to switch to a different tab.

More features are coming so stay tuned!
